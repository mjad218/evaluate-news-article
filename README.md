# Evaluate a news article using Natural Processing Language
A project for Udacity's Front End nanodegree. 

### Udacity Description 
The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall architecture. You shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups, or structure that we create here. Every project in the industry will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces, you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

#### Prerequisites 
Following are the project prerequisites:
1. Webserver - Node
2. Web application framework for routing - Express
3. Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
4. External script - Service Worker
5. External API - Aylien
